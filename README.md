# Particle Swarm Optimization visualization

Main goal of this project was to better understand Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm and learn basics of JavaFX.

### Settings

![Settings](/screens/settings.png)

In this view you can change following parameters of the algorithm:
- ```Population size``` number of particles
- ```C1``` how much difference betwen best position and current position of particle will affect speed update
- ```C2``` how much difference betwen best position of random particle and current position of particle will affect speed update
- ```w``` how much intertia from previous speed will affect speed change
- ```Max absolute paticle speed``` maximum absolute speed value of particle

### Initialization
